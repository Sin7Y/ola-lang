# Ola Compiler

The Ola Compiler compiles the high-level Ola contract code into the assembly code supported by OlaVM.

The general pipeline process is shown as

As can be seen from the above figure, the frontend of the compiler takes the high-level contract program as input and then compiles it into LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR); and the backend of the compiler takes the LLVM IR generated by the frontend as input and then compiles it into Ola assembly code.

The assembly code is eventually assembled, linked, loaded, and executed by OlaVM through the toolchain pipeline to generate a trace.
